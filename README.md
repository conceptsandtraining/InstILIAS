### Configuration
The Ilias-installer relies on a github-repository as the source of configuration files.  
The corresponding repo-paths should be specified in `$HOMEDIR/.ilse/config_repos.yaml`.  
Please refer to `config_repos_default.yaml` for the required layout.
   
The name of the config file is always `ilse_config.yaml`.  
Each config file is inside a directory that represents the customomer name.  

* Edit the file src/default.yaml
* Save the file as ilse_config.yaml
* Push the file into the destination folder of the repo named above.


### Required configuration entries
For new installation of ILIAS you need these configuration entries.
```
* client

* language
* server
* setup
* tools
* log
* git_branch
```
